## Challenges Faced and Solutions

1. **Country API Issues:**  
   - *Challenge:* When i tried to access country API it not work. 
   - *Solution:* As solution I was waited until fix it.

2. **Difficult to configuration with Tailwind CSS:**  
   - *Challenge:* Initially I was tried to use Tailwind CSS. But there were many issue occurs to configure. As a result, I wasted lot of time for project development. 
   - *Solution:* Finally I used Boostarp. It was easy to use.

3. **Map integration:**  
   - *Challenge:* Integrating Leaflet maps with React and handling dynamic updates.
   - *Solution:* Used `react-leaflet` for seamless React integration and optimized re-renders.

4. **Testing implementation:**  
   - *Challenge:* It was faced lot of challanges when developed the test cases for specially Home page like componenents.
   - *Solution:* Used Vitest and React Testing Library with mock API responses for robust test coverage.

5. **Deployment Issues:**  
   - *Challenge:* :** Initially, I tried to used Render platform. But it is not user friendly. Finally I was used vercel. (But it has 100 codes limits).Configuring Vercel deployment for both frontend and backend services. 
   - *Solution:* Used Vercel with separate frontend and backend deployments, and managed environment variables securely.

6. **Cross-Browser & Device Compatibility:**
